\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}
In Chapter~\ref{chapter:review} we reviewed the semi-quantitative, deconvolution, and compartmental methods to quantify tissue perfusion in various imaging modalities.
The difficulties in the detection of the arterial input function yielded to the development of reference tissue models for relative quantification of perfusion.
Indeed, a reference tissue can be selected in a large, well perfused area of the image, alleviating the risks of partial volume effect, and saturation artifacts.
While reference tissue models were used to quantify perfusion in positron emission tomography, X-ray computed tomography, and magnetic resonance exams, they were never applied to contrast-enhanced ultrasound data.

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:PMB} we compared a semi-quantitative approach based on the log-normal model \textbf{LN} to a one-compartment model using an arterial input function (\textbf{AIF}) in terms of reproducibility through preclinical test-retest contrast-enhanced ultrasound experiments.
This study revealed the higher reproducibility of \textbf{AIF} model compared to the semi-quantitative parameters of the \textbf{LN} model.
But the study also revealed the difficulties encontered in the estimation of the arterial input function and the impact of these variations on the estimated perfusion parameters.
Normalizing perfusion parameters of the \textbf{LN} and \textbf{AIF} models according to a reference tissue improved inter-exam reproducibility.
The direct estimation of relative perfusion parameters using a one-compartment reference tissue (\textbf{RT}) yielded the most reproducible parameters in our test-retest study.

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:PMB2} we established the relations between the parameters of the \textbf{LN}, \textbf{AIF}, and \textbf{RT} models.
These relations reveal the strong link between the semi-quantitative parameters of the \textbf{LN} model and the parameters of the compartmental approaches, but also explain the inter-exam variations observed in semi-quantitative parameters.
Normalizing perfusion parameters according to a reference tissue results in an improved robustness to inter-exam variations.
These analytical considerations were also verified experimentally in preclinical test-retest data.

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:IUS} we proposed a new regularized linear estimation method (\textbf{rReg}) for the relative perfusion parameters of \textbf{RT} model.
The model takes advantage of the functional heterogeneity of the tumor to regularize the estimation according to the reference tissue.
The reproducibility of the regularized model was assessed on the same preclinical test-retest data as in our previous studies.
Regularization significantly improved the reproducibility of perfusion parameters, in particular the improved reproducibility of relative blood flow was reported.

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:IRBM} and Chapter~\ref{chapter:PLOSONE}, we assessed the accuracy and precision of the estimates of the \textbf{rReg} model through simulation experiments.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:IRBM} focuses on the impact of recirculating contrast agent on the estimation of perfusion parameters.
In Chapter~\ref{chapter:PLOSONE} we presented the \textbf{rReg} in more details, and studied the impact of varying data characteristics, e.g.~exam duration, sampling period, or of quantification choices, e.g.~reference tissue, number of tissue regions.
These studies revealed the robustness of the \textbf{rReg} model to recirculation and degraded data, but also its ability to quantify perfusion homogeneously across tumor regions.

Overall, the \textbf{rReg} model proved a promising perfusion quantification tool, and its applicability to contrast-enhanced ultrasound data was demonstrated in this thesis.
When performing relative perfusion quantification in multiple regions, we highly recommend accounting for the relations between the regional model parameters to avoid regional inconsistencies, while making the estimation more robust.
Nevertheless, two-dimensional data still represents the majority of contrast-enahced ultrasound exams nowadays, making exam comparison extremely difficult.
Indeed it is particularly difficult to ensure the exact same imaging plane is selected in two exams performed days apart, and this is especially true when monitoring evolving tissues where structures change in shapes and size, e.g.~tumor growth, treatment response.
Therefore we highly recommend the use three-dimensional perfusion imaging whenever possible, in particular when it comes to exam comparison.

Three-dimensional perfusion imaging is vastly available in positron emission tomography, X-ray computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
However, application of the \textbf{rReg} model to other perfusion imaging modalities should be further investigated, and may require some adaptations to account for the characteristics of the data, the tissue, or the contrast agent.
Indeed, applicability of the estimation method to various compartmental architectures should be investigated in order to account for the characteristics of the tissue and contrast agent.
Further adaptation is also necessary in order to study perfusion in the liver, indeed the model needs to account for both the arterial and portal blood supplies.
Quantification of perfusion in the kidney remains challenging because of the complex vascular structures resulting in multiple perfusion phases, and should be addressed particularly.

The impact of the reference tissue on the perfusion parameters of the \textbf{rReg} was shown in Chapter~\ref{chapter:PLOSONE}, however a finer study is necessary to better define the characteristics of the ideal reference tissue. 
Accounting for multiple reference tissues may alleviate the sensitivity of the model estimates to the characteristics of the reference tissues.
However, using a reference tissue to monitor the perfusion of tumors undergoing therapy raises a question regarding the effect of the treatment on the perfusion of the reference tissue, especially in the case of anti-angiogenic treatments.

To conclude, choosing the quantification method to assess tissue perfusion through contrast-enhanced exams remains a complex problem that heavily depends on the data and on the goal of the study.
Exam comparison is particularly difficult because of variations occuring at both the experimental and physiological levels.
Reference tissue models proved more reproducible and robust than arterial input function models overall, however once accurate estimation of the arterial input function is achieved would it still be the case?
